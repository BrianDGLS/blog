This article covers how to hack the activity graph that appears on each github user's profile using **fake** commits.

![an example of a "full" github contribution graph](/images/contrib_graph.png)
*Above is an example of the aforementioned github contribution graph.*

The graph is generated by the number of commits matching a user's email and username. Due to this it is possible to add contributions by generating commits.

Below is a node js script which will generate these fake commits. In order to use this to generate your own commits update the `AUTHOR`, `EMAIL`, and `DAYS_TO_GENERATE` constants to match your github username, email, and number of days you wish to generate commits for, respectively. You will also need a version of node js that supports `async/await`. Running the script in the top level of a github project will generate the fake commits.

```javascript
const { join } = require('path')
const { writeFile } = require('fs')
const { promisify } = require('util')
const { exec } = require('child_process')

const execAsync = promisify(exec)
const writeFileAsync = promisify(writeFile)

const AUTHOR = 'username'
const EMAIL = 'email'
const DAYS_TO_GENERATE = 365

const dateMinusGivenDays = days => {
  const d = new Date()
  d.setDate(d.getDate() - days)
  return d
}

const touchFile = async path => await writeFileAsync(path, Math.random())

const addChange = async change => await execAsync(`git add ${change}`)

const makeCommitInPast = async (date, message) =>
  await execAsync(`GIT_AUTHOR_DATE='${date}' GIT_COMMITTER_DATE='${date}' git commit --author='${AUTHOR} <${EMAIL}>' -m '${message}'`)

const applyChanges = async limit => {
  const file = join(__dirname, 'temp.txt')
  const date = dateMinusGivenDays(limit)
  await touchFile(file)
  await addChange(file)
  await makeCommitInPast(date, Math.random())
}

const execute = async count => {
  while (count--) await applyChanges(count)
}

execute(DAYS_TO_GENERATE)
```
