I have entered [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/) this year. It is a javascript game competition in which the total game size must be less than 13kb. You can checkout my entry at the following url: [https://js13kgames.com/entries/connection-defender](https://js13kgames.com/entries/connection-defender).

Feel free to play around with the code on codepen at the following url: [https://codepen.io/BrianDGLS/pen/bxbveM](https://codepen.io/BrianDGLS/pen/bxbveM). 

The game is relatively small coming in at 4kb when zipped. Which is well below the 13kb limit.

Have fun playing and have a go at beating my high score of 9350.
