I am a Software Engineer living and working in Donegal, Ireland.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and am always looking to learn new things related to programming.

I mostly program in Typescript, Javascript, and PHP.
Though I always have an eye on new languages and frameworks that I would like to learn.

Feel free to check out my current projects on github. My username is [BrianDGLS][github].
