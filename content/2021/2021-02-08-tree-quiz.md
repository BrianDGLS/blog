I have recently published a quiz app using Angular 9 and Firebase. The [_Irish Tree Quiz_](https://irish-tree-quiz.web.app/) web app was created in order to help learn the native tree species of Ireland.

## Tech Stack

Irish Tree Quiz is an Angular 9 application. The app has basic quiz functionality. It is hosted on Firebase. The integration between Angular and Firebase is also flawless and easy to use, Google has done an excellent job here.

I found Angular 9 to be a very rewarding framework. There were many tools and plugins available to handle the more mundane development tasks. This meant that I could focus on the functionality of the application.
